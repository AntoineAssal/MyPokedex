# MyPokédex

The initial idea which inspired this React app is a [coding challenge](https://learn.co/lessons/react-pokemon-searcher) I found interesting when learning react.
I made a different version of it using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styling, and [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for getting Pokémon data.

## About

MyPokédex includes a Pokédex with 386 Pokémons from the first three generations and their name, ID, type, description, sprite and abilities. The homepage displays all Pokémon's names with their official artwork where users can select one and be redirected to a Pokémon specific page to view details about the Pokémon. Users can also search for the Pokémon they want to learn more about by typing name in the search bar and pick it from the filtered results by clicking on it's card.
